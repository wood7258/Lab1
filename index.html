        <h1>Lloyd Irving</h1>

        <p>Lloyd Irving is a human boy, and is the main character of the story. He is 17 years old, and struggles to keep up in school. However, he is a very honest, kind person who is willing to put himself into danger in order to protect his friends and family. He was raised by the dwarf Dirk, and as a result Lloyd's values and beliefs have been shaped by the Dwarven Vows. Lloyd's best friends include Colette Brunel, a fellow human, and Genis Sage, a half-elf. Raine Sage, Genis's sister, is the teacher at their school, so even though Lloyd doesn't do too well as a student, he and Raine tend to get along well.</p>
